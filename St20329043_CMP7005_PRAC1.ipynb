        "The dataset used in this project is the India Air Quality Dataset, collected from monitoring stations across 25 major cities. It includes pollution readings recorded between 2015 and 2020 from cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Kochi, Jaipur, and many others. The dataset contains key pollutants such as 🌫 PM2.5, 🌁 PM10, 🟡 SO₂, 🟦 NO₂, 🟥 CO, and 🟩 O₃ which are essential for assessing air quality. It also provides information on the city and year, allowing comparisons across different regions and time periods. This dataset is useful for studying pollution patterns, identifying highly affected cities, and observing how air quality changes over the years. It supports several key tasks in this project, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models. Overall, the dataset offers a clear and comprehensive view of air pollution in India and helps create meaningful visual and interactive analysis"
